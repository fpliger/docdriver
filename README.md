docdriver
=========

DocDriver is a reusable python application that generates documentation from source code files comments.

It's initial goal is to create a fast and more complete overview of software tests (idea started from 
functional tests simulating user tests using selenium webdriver - hence the name docdriver) a tool to
parse test files and generate useful documentation from tests source code comments.

It's often very hard to have enough visibility on tests code. Developers on the same team often need 
to look at the tests source code cit. "use the source Luke!") to understand what tests are really testing
and how. This gap is even larger when it non-developers need to have access to software testing 
and it's logics.
