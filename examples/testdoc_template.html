   <h1>1 Introduction</h1>

    <h2>1.1 Scope</h2>

    <p>Purpose of this document is to collect marked comments of text files and convert
        them to a well formatted human readable documentation that can be used as an official
        releast tests documentation or just as a nice looking overview of whats being tested.
        </p>

    <h2>1.2 References</h2>

    <p>The following documents are used to develop this document:</p>

        <ol>
            <li> User Requirements Specification</li>
        </ol>

    <h2>1.3 Background</h2>

    <p>This document is a fake document.. You have noticed that right?! :-)</p>

    <p>This document is a prove of concept of the new easy to use python module
        with the scope to create a fast and more complete overview of software
        tests (idea started from functional tests simulating user tests using
        selenium webdriver - hence the name docdriver, a tool to parse test files
        and generate useful documentation from tests source code comments)</p>

      <p>First, a few things before further reading:</p>

      <ul>
            <li>Documentation is damn important (and very hard to get right)!!
            Attention on this has been topic has sensibly increased in the last years
            and many cool tools like sphinx, read the docs & others have released
            </li>
          <li>Testing is damn important (and very hard to get right)!!
            Attention on this has been topic has sensibly increased in the last years
            and many cool tools and methodologies have been released
            </li>
          <li>Tests documentation is important too(and very boring to get right)!!
            </li>
        </ul>

      <p>It's often very hard to have enough visibility on tests code. Developers
      on the same team often need to look at the tests source code
          (cit. "use the source Luke!") to understand what tests are really testing
          and how.
          This gap is even larger when it non-developers need to have access
          to software testing and it's logics.
      </p>

    <h2>1.4 Testing general organization</h2>

    <h3>Tests Execution</h3>

    <p>
      This protocol is automatically generated with DocDriver from the software functional
      tests files. The tests execution will be automatically runned by the company continuous
      integration infrastructure simulating this tests protocol steps. The results and
      attachments mentioned in the following steps can be found in the following attachements
      locations: <attachments-url-path>

      NOTE: This protocol can also be be used by users & customers as template protocol to
      run their own custom tests set as they describe all the steps and details to follow
      in order to tests the application User Requirements (URS) described in the URS document.
    </p>

    <h3>Tests Cases Format</h3>

    <p>
      Each Test Case is structured according the following format:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Test code: it is the number which univocally identifies the test case;
            the code shall have the following format: TEST_###, where ### is the unique test code number.
        </li>
      <li>Description: Briefly describe the aim of the test.</li>
      <li>Test Procedure/Steps: A description of the steps to be followed to execute the test.
          Each step is numbered and associated to a dedicate acceptance criteria. Every step
          should contain the following columns:
            <ul>
                <li>id</li>
                <li>description</li>
                <li>expected result</li>
                <li>line no</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Protocol Acceptance Criteria</h3>

    <p>
      All the testing activities can be considered completed once all the tests listed in this
        document have been completed with positive results and all the deviations and related
        corrective actions have been evaluated and resolved.
    </p>


    <h3>Testing environment</h3>

    <p>
      Tests environment should be compliant with the system supported environments.
    </p>
